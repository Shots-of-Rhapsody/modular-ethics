# Ethics Testbed - Modular Moral Reasoning

**Ethics Testbed** is an experimental framework that translates ethical theories into **composable mathematical programs**.  
It is designed to make moral reasoning **transparent, auditable, and comparable** across different traditions of thought.  

The project is in active development & welcomes contributors who are interested in philosophy, mathematics, cognitive science, or applied AI ethics.

## üîç Purpose

Ethical debates often get stuck in rhetoric. This project aims to:

- **Formalize**: Represent normative theories (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics & others) in math-like evaluators.  
- **Separate**: Distinguish *facts* (causal models, probabilities) from *values* (weights, duties, virtues).  
- **Aggregate**: Handle pluralism by explicitly modeling moral uncertainty & combining multiple evaluators.  
- **Constrain**: Encode rights & duties as side-constraints, ensuring no rule-breaking is hidden in the math.  
- **Audit**: Generate explanation sets that highlight *which premises did the real work* in each recommendation.

## üß© Current Features

- Formal mathematical definitions of **Consequentialism, Deontology, & Virtue Ethics**  
- **Scenario schema (JSON)** for portable ethical case studies  
- Interactive **results viewer** with sliders to adjust credences & trait weights  
- **Normalization pipeline** to make modules comparable under aggregation  
- Clear UI/UX emphasis on **transparency and accessibility**

## üöß In Progress

- Expanding scenario library (policy, global health, AI decision-making)  
- Adding new modules: Rawlsian max-min fairness, contractualism, care ethics  
- Enhanced visualization: heatmaps, causal graphs & interactive explanations  
- Integration with external datasets (e.g., real-world triage protocols, public health stats)  
- Peer-reviewed research paper aligning the engine with cognitive science & mathematical theology

## üîÆ Future Directions

- Build a **scenario editor** so new dilemmas can be authored via the browser  
- Incorporate **probabilistic causal models** to test robustness of recommendations  
- Explore cross-disciplinary applications: legal reasoning, AI alignment & global policy  
- Develop a lightweight **API layer** for integration with other ethical/AI tools  
- Community-driven **axiom ledger** for iterative refinement of normative assumptions
