# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At this stage the **Ethics Testbed** is a research & experimental framework, not a production system.  
We will still track security updates for core code (engine & UI) to ensure safe collaboration.  

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| v0.3+     | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security concerns seriously, even in a research project.  
If you discover a vulnerability or weakness (technical, data-handling, or logic-related), please follow these steps:

1. **Private Disclosure**  
   - Send an email to: **[support@shotsofrhapsody.com or GitHub security advisory system]**  
   - Do not open a public issue until we’ve reviewed & confirmed the report.  

2. **What to Include**  
   - A clear description of the vulnerability (with file paths, reproduction steps, or example code if possible).  
   - Potential impact on the project (data exposure, integrity, denial of service, or misleading results).  
   - Suggested mitigation or patch ideas (optional but appreciated).  

3. **Response Time**  
   - Initial acknowledgment: within **7 days**.  
   - Status update or fix plan: within **14 days**.  
   - Public disclosure (if confirmed): coordinated with the reporter, once a patch or mitigation is available.  

4. **If Declined**  
   - We’ll provide reasoning (e.g., not exploitable in the research context, out of project scope).  
   - All reports remain logged & appreciated, even if not acted on.

## Philosophy of Security

Because Ethics Testbed handles **ethical reasoning models**, not sensitive personal data, vulnerabilities here are more likely to concern **integrity & correctness** (e.g., manipulation of scenarios, engine miscalculation, or malicious contributions).  
We view “security” not only as protecting infrastructure, but also as ensuring the **trustworthiness & transparency of reasoning outputs**.

## Recognition

Contributors who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be credited in release notes unless they request anonymity.
