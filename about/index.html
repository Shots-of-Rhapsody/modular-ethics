          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <p>My nameâ€™s Tai Song. I build systems.</p>
          <p>In trade and tech, I set up the structures behind how things move: products, information, decisions. I work on global markets, AI ethics, ESG contracts, and long-term planning. I rely on models, mental frameworks, and spotting patterns. I try to make things clear without locking them down.</p>
          <p>But Iâ€™ve always had two tracks going at once.</p>
          <p>Thereâ€™s the outside world I work in, and the internal one Iâ€™ve explored through stories. Theyâ€™re usually grounded in dynasties, cultivation, and old myths. My writing digs into power, change, and how hard it is to evolve without coming apart.</p>
          <p>Different tools, same mission. Figure out how things work, and shift them deliberately.</p>
          <p>One path helps me handle the world Iâ€™m in. The other keeps pushing me to ask what kind of world we should actually build.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="foundation" class="section">
          <h2>Foundation: What I Build</h2>
          <p>My work is about risk and design. It's about how to face what we donâ€™t see coming and plan for what comes next.</p>
          <p>I build systems that scan for early signals, track weird patterns, and flag potential threats before they show up at the front door. I work on ethics in AI, trying to keep automation tied to real accountability. I write contracts that translate ESG goals into actions people can actually track. I help shape digital infrastructure that can take a hit, follow the rules, and still move fast.</p>
          <p>None of this is static. These systems are built to learn and adjust as the world changes.</p>
          <p>I pull from a lot of fields: geopolitics, climate shifts, behavioral science, data law. When you line them up right, they donâ€™t just reduce risk. They create alignment. They help people move. They make resilience something you can actually build into the system.</p>
          <p>Every project is a custom setup. Itâ€™s not just about structure. Itâ€™s about intent. And making sure it holds when pressure hits.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="core" class="section">
          <h2>Core: What I Write</h2>
          <p>Alongside my strategy work, I write speculative fiction influenced by Xianxia, dynastic systems, and philosophy. Itâ€™s not a break from what I do. Itâ€™s another way of studying how systems shift, hold together, or fall apart.</p>
          <p>The stories look at the tension between personal drive and inherited structure. They ask what power costs, how people change, and what legacy really means. The worlds I build treat belief like architecture and culture like the ground it stands on.</p>
          <p>Every story is an experiment. A sealed system. A world with its own rules, with characters trying to bend or break them.</p>
          <p>Fiction gives me room to explore what data canâ€™t reach: moral consequences, long memory, and the inner logic that shapes how civilizations grow or collapse.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="ascension" class="section">
          <h2>Ascension: How I Work</h2>
          <p>I work with people who operate where systems are stressed or shifting.</p>
          <p>That might be where AI and ethics collide, where trade runs into climate limits, or where governance has to meet the power of narrative.</p>
          <p>Whether the job is navigating regulation, setting up accountability, or building fictional worlds that actually make sense, I bring a mix of structure and imagination. I move between domains, but I stay grounded in the details.</p>
          <p>Every project adapts to its environment. But the core goals donâ€™t change.</p>
          <p>Make things align. Make them hold up under pressure. And do it at scale.</p>

          <h2>ðŸŽ“ Lineage: How I Was Trained</h2>
          <p>My path started with two tracks: computer science and political science. I studied them side by side to figure out how systems work and who gets to shape them.</p>
          <p>Later, I moved into advanced work in cognitive science and cybersecurity. Thatâ€™s where I dug into how people understand risk, how systems break, and how behavior, attention, and outliers play off each other in messy environments.</p>
          <p>Later, I moved into a disciplined, formal study of philosophy, focusing on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Algorithmic ethics</li>
            <li>Decision theory under uncertainty</li>
            <li>Governance in autonomous systems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This work was backed by national research funding and took me from AI policy efforts in Asia to digital ethics projects across Europe.</p>
          <p>At each step, I mixed technical depth with systems thinking. I worked on governance models, oversight strategies, and decision tools that are now part of real-world infrastructure in public and private institutions.</p>

        <section id="certs" class="section">
          <h2>Certifications: Capital, Risk &amp; Trade</h2>
          <p>My training moved in stages. I started with capital and finance, which pulled me toward questions of risk. From there, I followed risk into global trade, where I began to see not just opportunity, but imbalance, pressure, and cost.</p>

          <h3>Capital</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)</strong> â€” CFA Institute<br><span class="muted">Focus: valuation under uncertainty, macroeconomic signals, global flows</span></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Risk</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Risk Manager (FRM)</strong> â€” Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP)<br><span class="muted">Focus: market, credit, and operational risk</span><br><span class="muted">Tools: stress-testing, volatility modeling for commodity-linked portfolios</span></li>
          </ul>

            <li><strong>Certified Trade Finance Professional (CTFP)</strong> â€” International Chamber of Commerce (ICC Academy)<br><span class="muted">Focus: trade credit, supply chain finance instruments, risk mitigation under ICC rules</span></li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Certificate in Trade Finance (ACTF)</strong> â€” ICC Academy<br><span class="muted">Focus: structured trade, ESG-linked contracts, global supply chain risk</span></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Compliance &amp; Integrity</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS)</strong> â€” ACAMS<br><span class="muted">Focus: financial crime detection, ESG audit readiness, KYC and supply chain transparency</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p>All of my certifications are up to date and kept active. I earned each one through formal exams and put them to work across real projects in the field.</p>

        <section id="infra-law" class="section">
          <h2>Specialized Studies: Infrastructure &amp; Law</h2>

          <h3>Blockchain Systems &amp; Digital Infrastructure</h3>
          <p>Iâ€™ve studied blockchain strategy through executive programs at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>University of Oxford (Oxford Blockchain Strategy Programme â€” SaÃ¯d Business School)</li>
            <li>MIT Sloan School of Management (Blockchain Technologies)</li>
            <li>Frankfurt School Blockchain Center (Blockchain and Crypto Assets Certificate)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Focus areas included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Smart contracts</li>
            <li>Tokenization</li>
            <li>ESG data traceability</li>
            <li>DLT-integrated compliance protocols</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These tools are now applied in structuring commodity contracts and digital ESG-linked systems.</p>

          <h3>Maritime Law</h3>
          <p>To better understand the legal side of global trade, I trained in Maritime Law through the Singapore Management University (SMU). This work supports:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>LNG and carbon-linked contract structuring</li>
            <li>Charter clauses</li>
            <li>Emissions regulation across jurisdictions</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>Each one came from a field I studied with intention. Over time, they added layers to how I work. Together, they changed how I see systems and how I try to build them.</p>
