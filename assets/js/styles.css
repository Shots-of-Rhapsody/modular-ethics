/* styles.css â€” compatibility shim
   This file intentionally delegates to the canonical site.css so older pages
   that still reference styles.css continue to look identical without duplication. */

@import url("site.css");

/* No additional rules needed:
   - The unified site.css already contains a scoped compatibility layer for
     <body class="minimal"> pages (header, menu, hero, buttons, footer).
   - Keep this file around for legacy HTML that still links to styles.css. */
