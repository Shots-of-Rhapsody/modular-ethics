    <h1>How Language Is Like Math</h1>
    <p class="lead muted">Both are rule-based symbol systems for creating and sharing meaning. The parallels run deeper than we often realize.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Symbols</h2>
      <p><strong>Language</strong> uses letters and words. <strong>Math</strong> uses numbers, variables, and operators.</p>

      <h2>Grammar (Syntax)</h2>
      <p>Language has grammar rules that tell us how to order words. Math has algebraic and logical rules that tell us how to arrange symbols.</p>

      <h2>Semantics (Meaning)</h2>
      <p>In language, a sentence points to an idea, object, or action. In math, an expression points to a value, quantity, or relationship.</p>

      <h2>Generativity</h2>
      <p>From a limited alphabet, language can generate infinite sentences. From a limited set of numbers and operations, math can generate infinite equations.</p>

      <h2>Precision vs. Ambiguity</h2>
      <p>Math leans toward exactness: <code>2+2=4</code> has one answer. Language tolerates ambiguity: the word “love” means different things depending on context. Yet both rely on shared rules to avoid chaos in communication.</p>

      <h2>Translation Across Domains</h2>
      <p>We can translate “five plus three” into <code>5+3</code>. Similarly, equations can describe real-world statements like “the apple falls” through Newton’s laws.</p>

      <h2>The Bridge of Logic</h2>
      <p>In essence, language is a system for expressing relationships between ideas, and math is a system for expressing relationships between quantities. Both are structured symbol games that let humans compress thought and share it with others.</p>
      <p>The fascinating bridge is <em>logic</em>: the skeleton that underpins both grammar and mathematics. It shows why philosophers and scientists often treat math as a formal language, just with stricter rules and fewer shades of gray.</p>
