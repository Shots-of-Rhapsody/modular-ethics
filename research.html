    <h1>Mathematics and the Structure of Reality</h1>
    <p class="lead muted">A research-style exploration of how mathematics underlies everything from particle physics to cognition and philosophical theology.</p>

    <!-- 1 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. The “Unreasonable Effectiveness” Thesis</h2>
      <p>Eugene Wigner observed that mathematics, often developed for its own sake, repeatedly anticipates structures later found in nature-an alignment that seems disproportionate to mere convenience. His puzzle frames our inquiry: why do formal symmetries map so tightly onto physical law? :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>2. Symmetry as a Unifier</h2>
      <p>One answer grounds the fit in symmetry: conservation laws and invariants in physics correspond to mathematical invariances. This view predicts that as we refine symmetry principles we refine the mathematics-and vice versa. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>3. Ontology of Mathematics</h2>
      <p>Debate persists over what mathematical entities are. Platonists posit abstracta that exist independently of minds; nominalists deny such objects; intermediate views proliferate. Our interpretations of “what math is” shape how we read its success in science. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>4. The Mathematical Universe Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>Tegmark’s MUH proposes that physical reality just <em>is</em> a mathematical structure. The view is programmatic and controversial, but it sharpens the explanandum: if physics reduces to structure, perhaps structure is all there is. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 5 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. Physics Driving New Mathematics</h2>
      <p>Historically, physics has catalyzed new mathematics-from calculus to group theory and differential geometry-and the flow continues in contemporary fields. The bidirectionality suggests a deep structural coupling rather than one-way description. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 6 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>6. Limits and Shadows</h2>
      <p>Even if mathematics is pervasive, its reach may be bounded. Incompleteness theorems signal internal limits on formal systems, while some argue that consciousness or emergent complexity resist total capture by equations. Our stance here is modest realism: models explain, they do not exhaust. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- NEW SECTION: Mathematical Theology -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>7. Mathematical Theology: Number, Law, and the Divine</h2>
      <p>Early modern science often cast nature as a book written in mathematics; Galileo’s formulation-“the language of mathematics” as the script of natural philosophy-became a cultural anchor for the unity of law and number. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</p>
      <p>Within analytic theology, a central question is how the existence (or non-existence) of abstract objects relates to divine aseity (God’s self-existence). Options include: (i) <em>theistic platonism</em> (some necessary abstracta exist independently of God), (ii) <em>nominalism</em> (no abstracta), and (iii) <em>theistic activism/voluntarism</em> (abstracta depend on the divine intellect or will). Each faces pressure from metaphysics and doctrine, e.g., whether abstract, causally inert entities could co-exist with a simple, personal God. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</p>
      <p>Ontological arguments-from Anselm to Descartes-probe whether a maximally great being’s existence follows from conceptual analysis. Regardless of verdict, their logic underscores how mathematical-style reasoning (modal, axiomatic, definitional) permeates classical theistic argument. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</p>
      <p>Our project takes no theological position. Methodologically, we treat “mathematical theology” as an exercise in model comparison: different metaphysical packages (about abstracta, modality, and divine attributes) generate distinct explanatory payoffs, which can be assessed for coherence and scope using the same comparative criteria we apply to scientific theories. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- NEW SECTION: Cognitive Science -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>8. Cognitive Science: The Mathematical Mind</h2>
      <p>Marr’s three levels-computational (what problem is solved), algorithmic (how it is represented), and implementational (how it is physically realized)-provide a rigorous scaffold for modeling minds. Mathematics enters at each level: objective functions, representational formats, and dynamics. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</p>
      <p>In contemporary theory, the brain is often modeled as a prediction machine: it minimizes error between expected and observed input. The <em>free-energy principle</em> and <em>predictive processing</em> families formalize this as approximate Bayesian inference under uncertainty, unifying perception, action, and learning within a mathematical optimization picture. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}</p>
      <p>Complementarily, cognitive science frames concept learning as statistical structure discovery: learners infer latent causes, compositional programs, and abstractions from sparse data-work capturing both flexibility and inductive bias in human learning. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}</p>
      <p>Open debates remain: about biological plausibility, about whether Bayesian/predictive accounts are explanatory or merely curve-fitting, and about the proper grain of mechanistic detail. These debates are healthy; they pressure-test where mathematics illuminates cognition and where it risks overreach. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Across physics, theology, and cognitive science, mathematics functions as a grammar of structure: a way to compress invariants, propagate constraints, and expose explanatory trade-offs. We do not infer that reality is <em>nothing but</em> mathematics; rather, we claim that mathematical structure is the most reliable handle we have for comparing models-of worlds, minds, and the ultimate.</p>
